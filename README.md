## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


### Links

- Live Site URL: [ITS ALIVE!](https://manuelrtz.github.io/order-summary-card/)

## My process

I start by observing the challenge and building from the outside in, creating the HTML structure and the sections that the project will have to carry out.

Once I have done the structure I am ready to use CSS to add the general details, such as fonts, color sizes and the main colored backgrounds.

Finally, I begin to align each section and adjust it (in this case with flexbox) and then give final details.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
